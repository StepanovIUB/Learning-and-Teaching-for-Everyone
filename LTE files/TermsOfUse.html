<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement ("Agreement") between you and LTE (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the LTE website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which LTE makes its services available (collectively, "Site"), our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications. The Site and Airbnb Services together are here in after collectively referred to as the “LTE Platform”. Our Guest Refund Policy, Nondiscrimination Policy and other Policies applicable to your use of the Airbnb Platform are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. </p>
<p>When these Terms mention “LTE,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the LTE website you are contracting with.
Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the LTE Platform is described in our <a href="privacypolicy.html" style="color: #A94343">Privacy Policy.</a> </p>
<p>Any and all payment processing services through or in connection with your use of the LTE Platform ("Payment Services") are provided to you by one or more LTE Payments entities (individually and collectively, as appropriate, "LTE Payments") as set out in the Payments Terms of Service ("Payments Terms").</p>

<h2>1. Scope of LTE services</h2>
<p> <span class="sub_number"> 1.1 </span> LTE Platform is a service for sharing activities that should connect people who want to teach or learn something. It is available to anyone and its primary mission is to connect people who share the same passion. The idea behind it is to provide people an opportunity to make valuable long-lasting connections through participating in the activities they enjoy. It means that we endeavor to be better than anyone else not only in the way we provide an activity to the user but also in what they get from participating in it, which makes us stand up among our competitors. </p>

<p> <span class="sub_number">1.2 </span> As the provider of the LTE Platform, LTE does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any classes or activities. Our users alone (Providers) are responsible for their classes and activities. When users create or join activities, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. LTE is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between its users. </p>

<p> <span class="sub_number">1.3</span> While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, LTE has no control over and does not guarantee (a) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any activity of class, (b) the truth or accuracy of any activity/class descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other content generated by users (as defined below), or (c) the performance or conduct of any user or third party.</p>
</div>

<div class="margins">

<p><span class="sub_number">2.2</span> You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction.</p>
<p> <span class="sub_number">2.3</span> The access to or use of certain areas and features of the LTE Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the LTE Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<div class="margins">
<h2> 3. Modification of these Terms </h2>
